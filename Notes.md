## Traverse array in reverse

1. First we make sure that there is enought space for array to grow. In worst case it can be 2\*n.
2. Now we are maitaining two pointers first which points to last element and second point to arr.length where size of array in 2\*n
3. Now if we encounter even number we will move it to last for two times.
4. For odd number we are doing this for one time.
